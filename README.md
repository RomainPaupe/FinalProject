## Project description
We are proud to deliver our movie discovery website, designed to help users explore and engage with their favorite films. This platform allows you to search for movies by title, genre, director, and more. You can also view ratings provided by other users and contribute your own reviews. The website is divided into two main sections. The first section focuses on enabling users to search for movies using various criteria, making it easier to find exactly what you’re looking for. The second section showcases the top 10 highest-rated movies on the platform, providing quick access to the most popular choices among our community. By clicking on a movie of interest, you can access detailed information such as the synopsis and statistical insights derived from user ratings, offering a comprehensive view of the film.

## Project repartition
To efficiently manage our work, we decided to divide the team into two smaller groups. Sandeep and Noémie took responsibility for the front-end development, focusing on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. Meanwhile, Romain and Yann concentrated on back-end development, ensuring the website’s functionality and data management. This division of labor allowed us to streamline our workflow, minimize potential conflicts during the development process, and avoid issues related to commit and push synchronization. By organizing our team this way, we were able to deliver a good project.
